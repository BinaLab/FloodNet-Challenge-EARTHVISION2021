<h1>FloodNet Challenge Track 1 - CVPR 2021</h1>

<h2>Important Dates</h2>


<h2>Challenge Overview</h2>

<p>Recent surge of different natural disasters has caused human and economic losses worldwide. 
The aftermath of these catastrophic disasters urges for quick humanitarian aid.
 However, manual rescue efforts are laborious and sometimes insufficient in reducing the great impacts of natural disasters. 
 Meanwhile, in recent times computer vision techniques have been evolved and improved a lot to tackle these challenges. 
 Moreover, post disaster analysis lacks high resolution imagery that would not only detect the damaged areas but also provides damage details. 
 This type of analysis will certainly help the rescue efforts and thus will reduce human and economic cost. 
 FloodNet provides high resolution UAV imageries with more information regarding the damages.
 Inspired by FloodNet and with an objective to perform a quick post disaster damage assessment, we propose a challenge on three different computer vision tracks.
 To advance the damage assessment process for post-disaster scenarios, we present a unique challenge considering 
 two tracks for UAV imagery based FloodNet dataset.</p>
 
 <ul>
  <li>Track 1</li>
  <li>Track 2</li>
</ul>

<h3>Track 1</h3>

<ul>

<li> <p> 	<b>Semi-Supervised Classification:</b> Classification for FloodNet dataset requires classifying the images (e.g. flooded or non-flooded) with few label data.
 This task will inspire the development of semi-supervised techniques that require few labeled data.</p> </li>
 
<li> <p> <b>Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation:</b> Considering the difficulties of annotation for semantic segmentation purposes, 
this challenge requires building a model for semantic segmentation with few labeled data.</p> </li>

</ul>

<h3>Track 2</h3>

<p><b>Visual Question Answering:</b> Visual question Answering is a multimodal task where a system provides an answer for a given question from an image. 
No work has been considered the VQA task for post-disaster damage assessment. To accelerate this task, we present the Visual Question Answering task for post-disaster damage assessment. <p>
